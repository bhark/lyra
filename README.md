# Lyra

Simple zero-trust password sharing with expiring and self-destructing links. No fancy - everything is kept as minimal as possible, as we aim to add a layer of security to secret sharing done by clients who would not bother to use complete suites. 

Encrypted values are stored by the server, while all encryption happens client-side. Secrets never leave the client machine, until they decide to share the link.
