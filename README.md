Simple no-storage password sharing with expiring links. No fancy - everything is kept as minimal as possible, as we aim to add a layer of security to secret sharing done by clients who would not bother to use complete suites. 

**NB**: The server has to be trusted, as it could log links and holds the secret. Please self-host this for internal use.
